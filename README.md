Welcome to the **Meals App** built with React Native! This app allows users to explore a list of meal categories, view the ingredients, and mark meals as favorites. It leverages Context API and Redux for state management to provide a smooth and efficient user experience.

## Features

1. **Meal Categories List**  
   The app displays a list of meal categories. You can easily browse through them to find the type of meal you're interested in.

2. **View Meal Ingredients**  
   Once you open any category, you can view the detailed ingredients of the meals within that category. Each meal is listed with its ingredients, helping you make an informed choice.

3. **Add/Remove Favorite Meals**  
   You can mark any meal as a favorite by simply selecting it. Similarly, you can remove it from your favorites anytime. 

4. **Favorite Meals Sidebar**  
   There's a sidebar where you can quickly access all your favorite meals. This allows for easy navigation and management of your favorite meals.

5. **State Management**  
   The app uses **Context API** and **Redux** for state management. This ensures that the application remains scalable, efficient, and easy to maintain as the state is handled in a centralized manner.
